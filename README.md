# AirSuiteGUI
<hr />
So are you tired of the command line interface? Well then chances are you are a script kiddie
Or maybe you just want to quicker way to use the airmon suite

With AirSuiteGUI you can do everything you could do before, but with a GUI
I myself prefer using command line but, we all have prefrences

Also when you are deauthing your neighbor from his WiFi because he has Netflix in the decibel
range of a small jet engine, you can do it in style because the gui doesn't look half bad

Please note that anything you do with this program you are responsible for, and any misuse
of this program probably won't end well so just... try to do things legally
